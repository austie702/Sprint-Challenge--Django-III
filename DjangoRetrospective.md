# Sprint-Challenge--Django-III

- Link to your Djorg repo, deployed site, and a summary of your status:
  - Did you reproduce the MVP apps we worked on together?
    - Yes. The home page, notes page, and bookmarks page all successfully deployed both locally and on heroku
  - Did you add 3rd party oauth?
    - I did not. I got tangled up in the following question.
  - How far did you get in adding your own app?
    - The MVP stage was the last stage that was fully functioning. I struggled to implement a stretch goal Todo List app, and lost the rest of my time to trying to debug that (remains unsolved, but that's ok. Building the entire thing from scratch is my next strategy).

- Describe the design of the app you added:
  - What data/models did you write?
    - All MVP data and models are present. Todo app attempted a replica of the bookmarks models
  - What packages did you use?
    - Nothing outside of the MVP
  - What features did you add?
    For a time, I had CSS styling using static pages, but I removed it until the project was finalized. Knowing how was the important part to me. 

- Future Plans with this Workflow:
  - Over time, I'd love to go through the old curriculum and slowly turn each project into a Django app here. Seems like great practice, but as all things, it will be subject to time. Love the idea tho.

Aaron, I can't thank you (and all the instructors) enough for this amazing experience. I will do my best to move forward into these labs using what I've learned to make Lambda proud.
